What is SkyNet:
---------------

SkyNet is an efficient and robust neural
network training code for machine
learning. It is able to train large and
deep feed-forward neural networks,
including autoencoders, for use in a
wide range of supervised and
unsupervised learning applications, such
as regression, classification, density
estimation, clustering and
dimensionality reduction. SkyNet is
implemented in C/C++ and fully
parallelised using MPI.
